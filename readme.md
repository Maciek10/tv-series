### UPDATE 13.03.2014 ###
Each show has now 'last watched episode' in the data, because using episodes list on Wikipedia for determining which was the last one I watched was painful.

### UPDATE 27.03.2013 ###
The list is now dynamically rendered based on data JSON files. You can find it here: [Tv Shows](http://michalbe.github.com/tv-series/).

## My TV Shows List
This is the list of all the TV series I've been watching since February 2008. I probably forget about some of them, so I'll update this list in near future. In the meantime - help me find some new interesting titles! If you want to propose something, just fork this repo and send pull request with the list updated in [TV Shows to consider](https://github.com/michalbe/tv-series/blob/master/data/proposals.js) part. Thanks in advance!
